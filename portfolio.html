                <p>For my class, CS 3451 Computer Graphics, I built a ray tracer using TypeScript. The ray tracer generated spheres and disks. I utilized the Phong shading model to include ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting. The model also accounts for colored lights and hard shadows.
                  <br> Below are images generated by my ray tracer.

                <p>For my Junior Design Project, I worked on a team to create an agriculturally-focused social networking website called Haystack. The site was first prototyped using Figma. Our team then built it using mySQL, React.js, HTML, CSS. The app's relational database was stored using Amazon Web Services, and we utilized a Node.js runtime environment to run our code. My specific role on our team was Director of Front End Development. I was responsible for the majority of User Interface prototyping. As for code, I oversaw all of the HTML elements and CSS, in addition to assisting with front end React.js logic.</p>
                <p>As for functionality, users on the site can accomplish a plethora of tasks including: creation of profiles, login, add friends, accept or deny friend requests, search for other users, view their profile and other's profiles, adjust privacy settings, post with or without images, comment and like posts, and discuss agricultural topics on forums.</p>

                <p>My current portfolio site (this website) is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The repository lives on Github, and the domain is hosted on AWS. Before building the site, I designed a prototype using Figma. A further step for my portfolio site is a tagging system to make it easier to organize and sort through projects. This would be implemented using React.js.

              <p>recycleATL is a prototyped iPhone application to encourage recycling on Georgia Tech's campus by making it easier for students to access recycling resources, as well as the locations of recycling receptables. It was created using Figma for the class, LMC 3710 Principles of Interaction Design. For this project, user research was conducted, scenarios and storyboards were created, and multiple versions of prototypes were iterated through. To present this project, I also created an accompanying website.</p>

                <p><b>Spring 2021</b></p>

                <p>Over the course of CS 2261 Media Device Architecture, I coded a series of GameBoy Advanced games written in C. The purpose of this class is to gain experience combining software with the limitations of hardware. I created 8-bit graphics, sound, and user interfaces using machine-level programming.</p>
                

                <p>For one game, I conceptualized my own mechanics to make <i>Penguin Plunge</i>. Players must move left and right to fall down from randomly-generated platforms that are moving upwards at a continuous speed. To gain points, the player collects fish. The game ends when the player hits either the top or bottom of the screen.</p>
                <div class="pics3">

                </div>

                <p>As another project, I recreated the classic game, <i>Space Invaders</i>. Invaders slowly moved down the screen, animating between two different variations of sprites. There were continuous shots thrown by randomly selected invaders; lives were deducted if a player was hit by the invaders' shots. The player could shoot a finite number of bullets at any time, and if the bullet collided with the invader, that invader would disappear. Finally, the game ended once the player ran out of lives or was touched by an invader. </p>

                </div>

                <p>The final game I implemented was the most difficult, <i>Tetris</i>. My version of <i>Tetris</i> included all of the original shapes and their rotational transformations. Sprites were implemented as the individual squares of each tetrimino, and the board was tracked as a matrix. Players won by eliminating a set number of rows or lost by having a tetrimino touch the top of the board. </p>

                <p><i>A Day in the Life of</i> is a text-based game created using Twine created for LMC 2410 Introduction to Game Studies. The premise of the game follows a dyslexic teenager, trying her best to make chocolate chip cookies. The ingredients list is represented as a gif where the letters move around and switch their order, making it difficult to follow the recipe. While the game is not representative of everyone's experience with dyslexia, it includes facts and statistics to raise awareness and understanding about the learning disability.</p>
